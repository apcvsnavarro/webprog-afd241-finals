    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi I'm Angelo, I am a third-year (irregular) student at Asia Pacific College, majoring in Information Technology with a focus on Mobile and Internet technologies. I have been passionate about computers since I was young.</p> 
      <p>I enjoyed creating this Robin from Honkai Star Rail themed project and exploring new web technologies.
      This site is hosted on Vercel and features a live guestbook powered by Supabase.

      My goal is to design engaging, responsive experiences for all usersâ€”whether on desktop, tablet, or mobile.
      Feel free to explore, leave a message, or connect!
